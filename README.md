# <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nixzee/nixzee-branding/master/images/nixzee-logo-base.png" width="100"> vscode-linux-nrf91-blinky

This repo provides everything you will need to get to blinky on the nRF9160 DK with Ubuntu, VScode (with debug), and GitHub CI/CD. Before going any further, I want to thank Edgar and his [nrf53 Blinky repo](https://github.com/edgargrimberg/nrf53_blinky) which was used as a reference.

## Motivation

I wanted the typical Blinky example for my board, the nRF9160 DK, that I could build, debug and flash through VS Code. Yes, I am aware of the nrf extension but I found it to be buggy and I wanted something more native. Additionally, I wanted to be able to do all of this outside of the nrf [SDK](https://github.com/nrfconnect/sdk-nrf) or [Zephyr](https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr) SDKs. I also wanted to have a [GitHub Action](https://github.com/features/actions) that would build the artifacts on a PR. My hope is that you can take this repo and use it as an example in your own projects.

## Directory Structure

The project directory structure is broken down as follows:

* [.github/](https://github.com/nixzee/vscode-linux-nRF91-blinky/tree/main/.github/workflows) - Directory that contains GitHub Actions.
* [.vscode/](https://github.com/nixzee/vscode-linux-nRF91-blinky/tree/main/.vscode) - Directory that contains VS Code configurations.
* build/ - Directory that contains the build artifacts. Is captured by the ```.gitignore```.
* [.docker/](https://github.com/nixzee/vscode-linux-nRF91-blinky/tree/main/docker) - Directory that contains the dockerfiles.
* [.src/](https://github.com/nixzee/vscode-linux-nRF91-blinky/tree/main/docker) - Directory that containes the source code. ```main.c``` is the entrypoint.
* cicd.sh - A script that assists with building local or in GitHub.
* prj.conf - A file that is used by [Zephyr's Kconfig](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/application/index.html)

## Parts

Below are list of parts to get you to blinky:

* 1x [nRF9160 DK](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/Development-hardware/nRF9160-DK/GetStarted)
* 1x Micro USB Cable

## OS (Ubuntu 20.04)

This project was developed in [Ubuntu 20.04.2 LTS](https://releases.ubuntu.com/20.04/) server minimal image. You can use another distro but some of instructions below rely on Debian. For my OS, I used [Virtual Box](https://www.virtualbox.org/) since I am lazy. I will not walk you through setting up the OS since there are countless tutorials. My settings are below (mileage may very):

* VDI with dynamic disk space at 20GB.
* Memory is set to 8GB.
* I am using NAT for Network and then port forwarding 22 to 22 (You can mangle if you want) for SSH.
* Post installation I did setup [KDE Minimal Desktop](https://kde.org/) so I could use the [nRF Connect for Desktop GUI](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/Development-tools/nRF-Connect-for-desktop). I have the desktop off by default and enable via ```init 5```.
* I use [ZSH](https://zsh.sourceforge.io/) with [Oh my Shell](https://ohmyz.sh/), instead of BASH because I am a fancy boi and I like my shell to have pretty colors.

## Development Tools Setup (Toolchain and Requirements)

To setup the tools you can use the [install manually](https://developer.nordicsemi.com/nRF_Connect_SDK/doc/latest/nrf/gs_installing.html) instructions found in the nrf sdk documnetation. However, I found a few gotchas and I am not sure you need everything they say you need. Below are my instructions that largely satify the [requirements table](https://developer.nordicsemi.com/nRF_Connect_SDK/doc/latest/nrf/gs_recommended_versions.html#gs-recommended-versions).

### Required Tools

1. Add the Kitware APT repository. Perform from the home user directory.

    ```shell
    wget https://apt.kitware.com/kitware-archive.sh
    sudo bash kitware-archive.sh
    ```

2. Install the depedencies as per the instructions.

    ```shell
    sudo apt install --no-install-recommends git cmake ninja-build gperf \
    ccache dfu-util device-tree-compiler wget \
    python3-dev python3-pip python3-setuptools python3-tk python3-wheel xz-utils file \
    make gcc gcc-multilib g++-multilib libsdl2-dev
    ```

3. Install additional depedencies. [Libncurses](https://packages.ubuntu.com/focal/libncurses-dev) is required for the GDB debugger later on.

    ```shell
    sudo apt install build-essential libncurses5 libncurses5-dev
    ```

4. Confirm that the dependencies are installed correctly.

    ```shell
    cmake --version
    python3 --version
    dtc --version
    ```

    Should output something like this:

    ```shell
    cmake version 3.22.0

    CMake suite maintained and supported by Kitware (kitware.com/cmake).
    Python 3.8.10

    Version: DTC 1.5.0
    ```

5. Perform cleanup.

    ```shell
    rm kitware-archive.sh
    ```

### West

[West](https://developer.nordicsemi.com/nRF_Connect_SDK/doc/latest/zephyr/guides/west/index.html#west) is Zephyr's build and management tool.

1. PIP install West to local user.

    ```shell
    pip3 install --user -U west
    ```

2. Add the ```./local/bin``` to your RC file (mine is ```.zshrc```). I like to manually add to my RC file to keep it organized. You can export is you want.

    Open the file

    ```shell
    nano ~/.zshrc
    ```

    Add this section and save and close:

    ```shell
    # For West
    export PATH=~/.local/bin:"$PATH"
    ```

    Source the file:

    ```shell
    source ~/.zshrc
    ```

3. Confirm West it working.

    ```shell
    west --version
    ```

    Should output something like this:

    ```shell
    West version: v0.12.0
    ```

### nRF Connect SDK

The [nRF Connect SDK](https://developer.nordicsemi.com/nRF_Connect_SDK/doc/latest/nrf/introduction.html#ncs-introduction) provides the nRF and Zephyr SDKs along with other depedencies, tools, and SVDs.


1. From the user home folder create and enter a directory called ```ncs```.
    ```shell
    mkdir ncs && cd ncs
    ```

2. Initilize West with the nRF Connect SDK and update. This will pull everything and take a few minutes. We will use the ```main``` release.

    ```shell
    west init -m https://github.com/nrfconnect/sdk-nrf --mr main
    west update
    ```

3. Confirm everything is there from the root of the ```ncs``` directory.

    ```shell
    ls -al
    ```

    Should output something like this:

    ```shell
    total 44
    drwxr-xr-x 11 nixzee nixzee 4096 Dec  6 15:31 .
    drwxr-xr-x  6 nixzee nixzee 4096 Dec  6 15:33 ..
    drwxrwxr-x  3 nixzee nixzee 4096 Dec  6 15:30 bootloader
    drwxrwxr-x 15 nixzee nixzee 4096 Dec  6 15:31 mbedtls
    drwxrwxr-x 10 nixzee nixzee 4096 Dec  6 15:32 modules
    drwxrwxr-x 21 nixzee nixzee 4096 Dec  6 15:29 nrf
    drwxrwxr-x 17 nixzee nixzee 4096 Dec  6 15:30 nrfxlib
    drwxrwxr-x  3 nixzee nixzee 4096 Dec  6 15:31 test
    drwxrwxr-x  4 nixzee nixzee 4096 Dec  6 15:32 tools
    drwxrwxr-x  2 nixzee nixzee 4096 Dec  6 15:29 .west
    drwxrwxr-x 22 nixzee nixzee 4096 Dec  6 15:30 zephyr
    ```

### Additional Python Dependencies

1. From the root of the ```ncs``` directory, run the following commands. This will take a few minutes.

    ```shell
    pip3 install --user -r zephyr/scripts/requirements.txt
    pip3 install --user -r nrf/scripts/requirements.txt
    pip3 install --user -r bootloader/mcuboot/scripts/requirements.txt
    ```

### GNU Arm Embedded Toolchain

We need to install the [GNU Arm Embedded Toolchain](https://developer.arm.com/tools-and-software/open-source-software/developer-tools/gnu-toolchain/gnu-rm/downloads) in order to cross compile and debug for the nRF9160.

1. From the user home directory, get the GNU Arm Embedded Toolchain and extract to the ```/usr/local```. This is different from the Nordic instructions. I prefer to keep my home directory prsitine. Once extracted cleanup. This will take a few minutes.

    ```shell
    wget https://developer.arm.com/-/media/Files/downloads/gnu-rm/9-2019q4/gcc-arm-none-eabi-9-2019-q4-major-x86_64-linux.tar.bz2
    sudo tar -C /usr/local -xvf gcc-arm-none-eabi-9-2019-q4-major-x86_64-linux.tar.bz2
    rm gcc-arm-none-eabi-9-2019-q4-major-x86_64-linux.tar.bz2
    ```

2. Like before, add the toolchain to ```PATH``` in your RC. Addtionally, instead of putting ```GNUARMEMB_TOOLCHAIN_PATH``` in the ```~/.zephyrrc```, I am also adding it to the RC file so that everything is one place. This is my preference and does make it persistent. Note that ```GNUARMEMB_TOOLCHAIN_PATH``` is pointing to ```/usr/local/gcc-arm-none-eabi-9-2019-q4-major```.

    Open the file

    ```shell
    nano ~/.zshrc
    ```

    Add this section and save and close:

    ```shell
    # GNUARMEMB for Zephyr
    export ZEPHYR_TOOLCHAIN_VARIANT=gnuarmemb
    export GNUARMEMB_TOOLCHAIN_PATH="/usr/local/gcc-arm-none-eabi-9-2019-q4-major"

    # GCC
    export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/gcc-arm-none-eabi-9-2019-q4-major/bin
    source ~/.zshrc
    ```

    Source the file:

    ```shell
    source ~/.zshrc
    ```

3. Test that ```GCC``` is working.

    ```shell
    arm-none-eabi-gcc --version
    ```

    Should output something like this:

    ```shell
    arm-none-eabi-gcc (GNU Tools for Arm Embedded Processors 9-2019-q4-major) 9.2.1 20191025 (release) [ARM/arm-9-branch revision 277599]
    Copyright (C) 2019 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
    This is free software; see the source for copying conditions.  There is NO
    warranty; not even for MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
    ```

4. Test that ```GDB``` is working.

    ```shell
    arm-none-eabi-gdb --version
    ```

    Should output something like this:

    ```shell
    GNU gdb (GNU Tools for Arm Embedded Processors 9-2019-q4-major) 8.3.0.20190709-git
    Copyright (C) 2019 Free Software Foundation, Inc.

    ```

### nRF Command Line tools

The [nRF Command Line Tools](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/Development-tools/nrf-command-line-tools/download) is an archive that provides tools to program the microcontroller.

1. Install unzip since the tools are stored in a zip even for Linux.

    ```shell
    sudo apt-get install unzip
    ```

2. Download the zip of the tools from Nordic and unzip. I recommend create a directory first for easy cleanup later. Make sure you download the latest version. As of writing this, the latest is ```10-15-1```.

    ```shell
    mkdir nrfcommtools && cd nrfcommtools
    wget https://www.nordicsemi.com/-/media/Software-and-other-downloads/Desktop-software/nRF-command-line-tools/sw/Versions-10-x-x/10-15-1/nrf-command-line-tools-10.15.1_Linux-amd64.zip
    unzip nrf-command-line-tools-10.15.1_Linux-amd64.zip
    ```

    if you ```ls``` the directory, you should see something like this:

    ```shell
    JLink_Linux_V758b_x86_64.deb
    JLink_Linux_V758b_x86_64.tgz
    nrf-command-line-tools-10.15.1-1.amd64.rpm
    nrf-command-line-tools_10.15.1_amd64.deb
    nrf-command-line-tools-10.15.1_Linux-amd64.tar.gz
    nrf-command-line-tools-10.15.1_Linux-amd64.zip
    ```

3. Install the ```JLink``` and ```nrf-command-line-tools``` debian packages. Make sure to update the version if different.

    ```shell
    sudo dpkg -i JLink_Linux_V758b_x86_64.deb
    sudo dpkg -i nrf-command-line-tools_10.15.1_amd64.deb
    sudo apt-get install -f
    ```

4. Confirm ```JLink``` is working.

    ```shell
    JLinkExe --version
    ```

    Should output something like this:

    ```shell
    SEGGER J-Link Commander V7.58b (Compiled Nov 16 2021 15:04:43)
    DLL version V7.58b, compiled Nov 16 2021 15:04:27
    ```

5. Confirm ```nrf-command-line-tools``` is working.

    ```shell
    nrfjprog --version
    ```

    Should output something like this:

    ```shell
    nrfjprog version: 10.15.1 external
    JLinkARM.dll version: 7.58b
    ```

### Docker

The following steps are to install Docker. [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is used to create/use containers. This will be used later for CICD. Its also handy is you want to generate artifacts and dont want to setup a complete development enviroment.

1. Update and get dependencies.

    ```shell
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl gnupg-agent software-properties-common
    ```

2. Install.

    ```shell
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io
    ```

3. Test by running the following command.

    ```shell
    sudo docker --version
    ```

    You should see something like this:

    ```shell
    Docker version 20.10.10, build b485636
    ```

4. Now we need to give non-root access to docker because of reasons...

    ```shell
    sudo groupadd docker
    sudo gpasswd -a $USER docker
    ```

5. Now after next session login or reboot you should be able to run docker commands as non-root (no sudo).

### Confirm Its Working

At this point, you should be able to build and flash from command line. This section will test that.

1. Navigate to the nRF9160 AT Client sample.

    ```shell
    cd ncs/nrf/samples/nrf9160/at_client
    ```

2. Build the sample using the ```nrf9160dk_nrf9160_ns``` board arguement. This is specifying to build for the nRF9160 DK in non-secure. This will take a few minutes the first time.

    ```shell
    west build -b nrf9160dk_nrf9160_ns
    ```

3. Finally, flash it. If you are using a VM, don't forget to attach the device. For Virtual Box on my machine, I select ```Devices >> USB >> Segger J-Link```.

    ```shell
    west flash
    ```

    The output will look something like this:

    ```shell
    -- west flash: rebuilding
    [0/11] Performing build step for 'spm_subimage'
    ninja: no work to do.
    -- west flash: using runner nrfjprog
    Using board 960094144
    -- runners.nrfjprog: Flashing file: /home/nixzee/ncs/nrf/samples/nrf9160/at_client/build/zephyr/merged.hex
    Parsing image file.
    Verified OK.
    Applying pin reset.
    -- runners.nrfjprog: Board with serial number 960094144 flashed successfully.
    ```

## Development Enviroment Setup

This project makes use of [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) as its IDE. I prefer VS Code because its free and runs on anything, stable, many extensions, and can be used with many languages. This project makes use of some extensions like Cortex-Debug and C/C++ IntelliSense. More info and instructions below.

### Clone The Repo

Before cloning the repo, make sure you have [setup an SSH authentication on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh). Additionally, if you are seperating your proffesional and personal GitHub accounts do not forget to setup ```~/.ssh/config``` with the appropriate hostname and identities in ```~/.gitconfig```. Then when cloning, swap the hostnames accordingly or you will have a bad time. If you do not have seperate accounts, just clone.

1. We will need to clone the repo into the ```ncs``` directory. This is because West does some stupid stuff with [workspaces](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/guides/west/basics.html).

    ```shell
    cd ~/ncs
    git clone git@github.com:nixzee/vscode-linux-nrf96-blinky.git
    ```

### Install VS Code

Before continuing, please realize these intstructions are for installing VS Code onto a Windows machine and then using the [Remote Development Extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/remote-overview) to SSH into the VM. You can install VS Code natively if you want and use the same extensions.

1. Install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for your development machine. Install for Windows.

2. Once installed, we install the first plugin. Off to the left, there is a bar with icons. One of the icons looks like blocks. Click on it. Type into to the box ```Search Extensions in Marketplace```, ```Remote Development``` Click on it and click install. Once done, reload VS Code by closing and re-opening.

3. Next we need to connect to VM. You should a green box on the lower left. Click it. A window will popup at the top. Select ```Remote SSH: Connect to Host...```. Click on ```Add New Host``` put in the following (swap the IP for the IP of the VM).

    ```shell
    nixzee@<IP>
    ```

4. Following any prompts.

5. Open the project. Click ```File >> Open Folder```. Select ```vscode-linux-nrf96-blinky```. Click OK. Enter your password.

6. We will now install all the plugins. As before, click on the plugins icon. We will instll the following on. Some of these are not really neccisary but handy to have.

    * C/C++
    * C/C++ Intellisense
    * Cortex-Debug
    * Docker
    * CMake
    * CMake Tools
    * Doxygen Documentation Generator
    * markdownlint
    * Todo Tree

7. Perform a window reload <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>shift</kbd>+<kbd>p</kbd> and type ```window reload``` and hit enter. Log back in.

8. Now we need to select the CMake kit so that CMake knows which compiler to use. On the very bottom on the blue tool bar you should see something with a tool icon and says ```No Active kit```. Click it and click the ```Scan for Kits``` at the top of the window. Wait for it to finish. Now select the ```No Active kit``` again. Select ```GCC 9.2.1 arm-none-eabi``` at the top of the window. This is the toolchain we installed earlier.

9. Confirm that CMake is working. Click the ```Build``` in the blue bar at the bottom of the screen. If works you should see something like this.

    ```shell
    ...
    [build] [170/171  99% :: 13.172] Linking C executable zephyr/zephyr.elf
    [build] Memory region         Used Size  Region Size  %age Used
    [build]            FLASH:       29176 B       960 KB      2.97%
    [build]             SRAM:        6528 B     178968 B      3.65%
    [build]         IDT_LIST:          0 GB         2 KB      0.00%
    [build] [171/171 100% :: 13.449] Generating zephyr/merged.hex
    [build] Build finished with exit code 0
    ```

The next time you connect, click the green box again and select your device. You will need to open the project folder each time since the connection will take you to home.

---

## Building and Debug

At this point, you have a few ways you can build. You can build manually from command line using West directly or using VS Code. Additionally, VS Code will allow you to debug (break point, single step, etc). with the use of the [Cortex-Debug](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=marus25.cortex-debug) extension. Before continuing, make sure you have plugged in the nRF9160 DK board and attach to your VM is using one.

### Debug From VS Code

1. With VS Code open and in the repo diretory, click ```Run >> Start Debugging```. VS Code will then build and flash the board (A lot is happening behind the scenes). If succesfull, the debug instance will pause on ```compiler_barrier()```;. Just hit the resume button.

2. At this point you are now debugging. You can add break points and single step through the source code. Additionally, you should be able to see your variables, create watches, see the callstack, and look at the Cortex peripherals and registers.
